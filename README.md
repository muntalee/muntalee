# Hello World 👨🏽‍💻

Recently started using GitHub (as of Nov 7th 2021)\
I just put my projects that I work on here for easy access 

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python3

class AverageCSStudent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Muntasirul Islam"
        self.preferred_name = "Munta"
        self.pronouns = "he/him"
        self.lang = "en_US"
        self.role = "CS Student"
        self.college = "Toronto Metropolitan University"

    def hello(self):
        print("Hello there! Thank you for visiting my GitHub Page!")
        print("I'm working towards a portfolio website for myself, but for now this will do")
        print("But for now, look around, give me some stars, whatever you like")

if __name__ == '__main__':
    munta = AverageCSStudent()
    munta.hello()
```
